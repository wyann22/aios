# AIOS - LLM Inference Learning Project

This is a hands-on learning project designed to teach LLM inference fundamentals to anyone interested in AI and Large Language Models. Through step-by-step implementation of an LLM inference framework, you'll build essential functionality from the ground up, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced techniques.

## Course Curriculum

### Module 1: Foundations
1. **LLM Basics** - Understanding transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, and model parameters
2. **PyTorch Fundamentals** - Tensor operations, autograd, and model building essentials

### Module 2: Model Execution
3. **Running Llama2 with PyTorch** - Loading pre-trained models and performing inference
4. **Tokenization** - Implementing and understanding tokenizers (BPE, SentencePiece)
5. **Text Generation** - Autoregressive generation, sampling strategies (greedy, top-k, top-p, temperature)

### Module 3: Optimization Techniques
6. **Memory Management** - KV-cache implementation, memory-efficient attention
7. **Quantization** - INT8/INT4 quantization for reduced memory footprint
8. **BatchProcessing** - Efficient batch inference and dynamic batching

### Module 4: Advanced Inference
9. **Inference Acceleration** - Flash Attention, operator fusion, and kernel optimization
10. **Multi-GPU Inference** - Tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism
11. **Serving Optimization** - Continuous batching, request scheduling, and throughput optimization

### Module 5: Production Readiness
12. **Model Serving** - Building an inference API server
13. **Monitoring and Profiling** - Performance metrics, latency tracking, and bottleneck analysis
14. **Deployment Strategies** - Containerization, scaling, and production best practices

## Learning Approach

Each module builds upon the previous one, allowing you to:
- Implement core functionality yourself to deeply understand how LLM inference works
- Experiment with different techniques and observe their impact
- Progress at your own pace from basic concepts to production-grade implementations

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with deep learning concepts (recommended but not required)
- Interest in understanding how LLMs work under the hood
